# Online-Voting-System

The proposed system aims to address the limitations and challenges faced by the current student election process at Strathmore University. Currently, only a selective group of individuals, such as class representatives, sports team captains, and club chairpersons, are allowed to vote on behalf of the entire student body. This practice raises concerns of fairness and transparency, as it does not account for the preferences of all university students.

To overcome these challenges, the web-based student council voting system will be designed to enable all students to vote for their preferred student council leaders. The system will capture candidates' and voters' details, facilitate the casting of ballots, and generate reports for the election process. It aims to enhance transparency, integrity, and efficiency in the election process, fostering a stronger sense of community and student representation at Strathmore University.

The system will be developed using a prototyping methodology, allowing for iterative improvements based on user feedback and requirements. Leveraging web technologies and secure databases, it will ensure the privacy and accuracy of the voting process. Thorough testing will be conducted to assess the system's usability, performance, and effectiveness in meeting the identified requirements.
